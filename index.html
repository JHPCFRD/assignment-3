            <p>If you're ever feeling hungry after you just got done with an hour and fifteen minute class at the Petty Building, come down Tate Street.
                It's barely five minutes away, and it's a popular place many students go to whenever they start to feel the rumblies.
                From burgers to pizza to noodles, they have it all.
                Here are my three recommendations to satiate those cravings.

            Slices is a place that I'd frequent with my friend because of its affordable price.
            If there's any place you want to become a regular at, it's there!

        While I'd say it's worth trying every place at Tate Street especially since you'll probably be near there
        throughout the semester, these were my recommendations to either start with or stick with!
        Thank you for checking out my blog!
